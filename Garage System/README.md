A small console-based Garage Management System built in C++.

This project was created while learning object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, constructors, destructors, dynamic memory, and arrays of pointers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**What This Project Covers**

- Creating and using custom classes
- Constructors and destructors
- Dynamic memory management (`new` / `delete`)
- Pointer-to-object usage
- Encapsulation (private members, public methods)
- Searching for the best value (highest range)
- Removing elements from an array (with shifting)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Structure:

**Vehicle Class**
Represents a vehicle with:
- Name
- Number of passengers
- Fuel capacity
- Miles per gallon

**Includes:**
- `range()` function
- `printVehicle()` function

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Garage Class**
Manages multiple vehicles using an array of pointers.

Features:
- Add vehicles
- Remove vehicles by name
- List all vehicles
- Find the vehicle with the best range
- Destructor to prevent memory leaks
